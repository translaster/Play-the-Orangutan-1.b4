# Chapter 5: Grünfeld Indian Set-ups

Several lines transpose to other openings, some classified as the English Opening, and some are, technically speaking, a Grünfeld proper. The lines in this chapter have in other works often been covered together with the King’s Indian lines, but since they are quite distinctive and very Grünfeld - like, it makes sense to cover them separately. Nevertheless, I have chosen quite rare lines but offer White excellent chances to play for an advantage.
1.b4 Nf6 2.Bb2 g6
Another move order is 2...d5 3.e3 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.c4 dxc4 (both 5...0-0 and 5...c6 will take us to lines that are covered below) 6.Bxc4 0-0 7.0-0 Nbd7 (or 7...c6 8.a4 Nbd7 9.d4 Nd5 10.b5 N7b6 11.Be2 cxb5 12.axb5 Bg4 13.Nbd2 h6 14.h3 Be6 15.Nb3 Nf6 16.Nc5 and White has a large advantage, Känel-Z.Ilic, Bern 1989) 8.d4 b6 9.Qe2 c6 10.a4 Nd5 11.b5 was played in Känel-Gheorghiu, Lenk 1995, and here the players settled for a draw, ½–½, but White is already comfortably better, for instance, 11...Bb7 12.bxc6 Bxc6 13.e4 Nc7 14.Rc1 Bb7 15.h4 Nf6 16.Nbd2 and it is obvious that Black has a miserable position.
3.c4 Bg7 4.Nf3 0-0
4...c6 5.e3 0-0 transposes to 4...0-0 5.e3 c6.
5.e3 d5
Another Grunfeld Indian set-up is 5...c6, aiming for a Schlechter Variation type of set-up.


    A) 6.d4!? takes the game into lines that are classified as an English Opening. Now 6...d5 7.a4!?
White has two alternatives that numerous strong players have played many times, 7.Nbd2 and 7.Nc3, but I do not think they offer White anything. Therefore, I recommend this four-pawn queenside attack, a specialty of the Swiss international master Hansjürg Känel.
Objectively speaking, Black should be able to equalize. Still, my experience is that Black’s position is not as easy to play as White’s, giving us an excellent opportunity to outplay Black even when Black plays the best continuation.
Despite White’s continuation being relatively rare, Black has tried a few different things in this position:


        a) 7...Bf5 8.a5!? (untried; the more common option is 8.Nbd2!? Nbd7 (8...Ne4 9.Be2 Nxd2 10.Qxd2 dxc4 11.Bxc4 Be4 12.Qe2 Nd7 13.0-0 and White had more space and the slightly better chances, Ulanov-Korniushin, Ekaterinburg 2013) 9.Be2 Ne4 (after 9...a5 I prefer 10.b5 cxb5 11.axb5 dxc4 12.Nxc4 for White) 10.0-0


and now 10...Nxd2 (10...Re8 11.cxd5! cxd5 12.Nxe4 Bxe4 13.Qb3 Rc8 14.Rac1 Nf6 15.Ne5 Bf5 16.f3 and the French #1 was clearly struggling as Black, So-Vachier Lagrave, Chess.com INT 2017; 10...Ndf6 11.a5! or 11.b5!?, in both cases White has the initiative) 11.Nxd2 e5 12.cxd5 cxd5 13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.Bd4 Re8 was Morovic Fernandez-Darcyl, Buenos Aires 2017, and now 15.Nb3 Rc8 16.Ra2 Qc7 17.Qa1 would White would have had an edge) 8...Ne4 9.Qb3 Na6 10.Nc3 (White can also consider 10.cxd5 Qxd5 11.Bc4 Qd6 12.Ra4 with an interesting position) 10...Nxc3 11.Bxc3 Be4 12.h4!? (a fun alternative to 12.Be2 dxc4 13.Bxc4 Bxf3 14.gxf3 with chances to both sides) 12...dxc4 13.Bxc4 Nc7 14.h5 Qd7 15.Rh4 and while the chances are more or less even, we are having fun.
        b) 7...Bg4 8.Nbd2 a5 9.b5 dxc4 10.Bxc4 cxb5 11.Bxb5 Nc6 12.0-0 Rc8 13.h3 and White has a pleasant advantage with an extra central pawn, M.Richter-Krefenstein, Berlin 2014.
c) 7...Nbd7 8.Nbd2 (or 8.Nc3 a5 9.b5 c5 10.Nxd5 Nxd5 11.cxd5 Nb6 12.e4 e6 13.d6 cxd4 14.e5 f6 15.Bxd4 fxe5 16.Bxe5 Bxe5 17.Nxe5 Qh4 18.Nf3 Qb4+ 19.Qd2 is assessed as equal by my computer but I still think White has the better chances due to Black’s perforated pawn structure) 8...e5 (or 8...Re8 9.Be2 Ne4 10.0-0 (White achieves less with 10.Nxe4 dxe4 11.Nd2 e5 12.dxe5? (12.d5!? would have been a decent try for more; after the capture on e5, Black is simply better) 12...Nxe5 13.Nxe4 Bf5 14.Nd6 Nd3+ 15.Bxd3 Qxd6 16.Bxg7 Bxd3 17.Bc3 Rad8 with a clear advantage for Black, G.Szabo-Dragomirescu, Sarata Monteoru 2012) 10...Nxd2 11.Nxd2 e5 12.cxd5 cxd5 13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.Bd4 and White has a positional plus) 9.dxe5 Ng4 10.cxd5 (10.Bd4!?) 10...Ngxe5 11.Qb3 (11.Qc2!?) 11...a5 12.Be2 axb4 13.Qxb4 Nxf3+ 14.Nxf3 Bxb2 15.Qxb2 Qa5+
16.Qd2 Qxd5 17.Qxd5 cxd5 18.Nd4 Nc5 19.Bb5 and White has at most a tiny plus on account of Black’s isolated d-pawn.
    d) 7...a5 8.b5 cxb5 9.axb5 dxc4 10.Bxc4 b6? (this looks normal but leaves Black with a structural weakness on c6) 11.0-0 Bb7 12.Nbd2 Ne4 13.Nxe4 Bxe4 14.Ne5 Ra7 15.Qb3 with a clear advantage for White, Känel-Zollbrecht, Biel 2004.
    e) 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 a5 (if 8...Nd5 then 9.b5 a6 10.Nbd2 axb5 11.axb5 Rxa1 12.Qxa1 is better for White) 9.bxa5 Qxa5+ 10.Nbd2 c5 11.0-0 cxd4 12.Nxd4 Bd7 13.Nb5 and White has a small plus.
    B) White can also play the immediate 6.a4!? d5 7.Be2 dxc4 8.Bxc4 Bg4 9.0-0 with a comfortable position for White, who can decide to play d2–d4 sooner or later with a space advantage for White.
    C) A far more common option is 6.Be2 d5 (another idea is 6...a5 7.b5 cxb5 8.cxb5 d5 (or 8...d6 9.0-0 Nbd7 10.d3 Nb6 11.a4 Nfd5 12.Qd2 Bxb2 13.Qxb2 Nb4 14.h3 and the chances are about even) 9.a4 (or 9.0-0!? Nbd7 10.d4 Nb6 11.Nbd2 Ne8 12.a4 Nd6 13.Rc1 f6 was played in McNab-Hennigan, Isle of Man 1993, and now 14.Ba3 would have given White pleasant advantage) 9...Ne4 10.Bxg7 Kxg7 11.Qb3 Qd6 12.Qb2+ Nf6 13.h3 Nbd7 14.0-0 and the chances are more or less equal) 7.cxd5 (7.0-0 is the main line move which has been played in more than 100 games and Black is probably doing fine after 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 b5 9.Be2 a5; a fun alternative is 7.Na3 Bg4 8.h3 Bxf3 9.Bxf3 a5 10.b5 dxc4 11.bxc6 Nxc6 12.Nxc4 Rc8 was played in Kryakvin-Duzhakov, St Petersburg 2019, and now 13.Qb3 Nb4 14.d4 gives White a small advantage) 7...Nxd5 (if Black is playing to equalize then the recapture with the pawn is the better option, for instance, 7...cxd5 8.0-0 Bg4 9.a4 Nc6 10.b5 Na5 11.d3 when I prefer White but Black should not be worse) 8.Bxg7 Kxg7 9.Qc2 Kg8 10.a3 a5
11.bxa5 Rxa5 12.d4 Bg4 13.Nbd2 when I prefer White but Black should close to equal.
6.cxd5 Nxd5


The knight capture is the more logical option of Black’s choices. The dark-squared bishops will now be exchanged. Who does that favor? I think the exchange is in White’s favor, even if it is nothing dramatic.
The alternative is 6...Qxd5 7.Nc3, and here:
    a) 7...Qd8 8.Be2 (this is probably best but White can also consider 8.Bc4 Nc6 9.b5 Na5 10.Be2 Bg4?! (10...a6!?) 11.0-0 Bxf3 12.Bxf3 e5 13.d3 c6 14.a4 and White has a small but clear advantage thanks to the bishop pair and pressure against Black’s queenside, G.Jones-Aakanksha, Chess.com INT 2020) 8...Nbd7 (as usual, some Black players will consider 8...a5 9.b5 Nbd7?! (if Black plays to exchange two sets of minor pieces on c3, then 9...Nd5 10.d4 c6 11.0-0 Bf5 12.a4 leaves White with a pleasant position) 10.0-0 Nb6 11.Na4 Nbd5 12.Be5 Bg4 13.h3 Bxf3 14.Bxf3 e6 15.Rc1 Ne8 16.Bxg7 Kxg7 17.Nc3 and White is firmly in control of the game, if not to say, Black has a horrible position, M.Jirovsky-Reschke, Germany 2004) 9.0-0 e5 10.d3 c6 11.a4 (preparing White’s campaign on the queenside) 11...b6 (11...a5 12.b5 is good for White) 12.Qb3 Re8 13.Rfd1 Qe7 14.d4! (14.Nd2!? can also be played) 14...exd4 15.exd4 Nf8 16.Ne5 Be6 17.Qa3 Rac8 was seen in
Kurajica-Firat, Izmir 2016, and here 18.b5 Qxa3 19.Rxa3 c5 20.d5 Bd7 21.f4 would have given White a pleasant advantage.
    b) 7...Qd6 8.a3 (or 8.Nb5 Qd8 9.Bc4 c6 10.Na3 Nbd7 11.0-0 Nb6, which was played in Sydor- Zoltek, Bydgoszcz 1976, and now 12.Be2 Be6 13.h3 Qd7 would have been very close to equal) 8...Bg4 9.Be2 Nc6?! (the knight almost certainly does not belong on this square; a more solid and better option was 9...c6 10.d4 Nbd7 11.0-0, which is pleasant for White and quite boring for Black, which often happens in this line) 10.d4 e6? (10...Rfd8 is still playable for Black) 11.h3 Bxf3 12.Bxf3 a6 13.0-0 Rab8 14.Rc1 Rfc8 15.Na4 and Black is close to being busted, Lebredo Zaragoitia-DeWinter, Mexico City 1978. 7.Bxg7 Kxg7 8.Qb3 Qd6 Two alternatives are:
a) 8...c6 9.Nc3 Qd6 10.Bc4 Nxc3 11.Qxc3+ f6 12.a4 Bg4 13.Be2 e5 14.0-0 Nd7 15.h3 Be6 16.d4
and White has the initiative, Triapishko-Mirzaev, Yaroslavl 2019.
b) 8...Nb6 9.Qb2+ f6 10.d4 (or 10.Be2 c6 11.0-0 and White is better) 10...Qd6 11.Nbd2 a5 12.b5
Be6 13.Be2 and White’s position is both better and easier to play.
    9. a3


9...a5
Some other options are:
a) 9...c5 10.Nc3 Nf6 11.Be2 cxb4 12.Qxb4! and White has a strong initiative on the queenside.
b) 9...e5 10.Nc3 Nxc3 11.Qxc3 Re8 12.Rc1 (or 12.Be2 Nd7 13.0-0 Nf6 14.d3 Bg4 15.b5 h6 16.Rfc1
and White has pressure on the queenside, Steinbacher-Van Wessel, Groningen 1994) 12...c6 13.d4
Nd7 14.dxe5 Nxe5 15.Be2 and White has the initiative.
    10. b5 c5
Or 10...c6 11.d4 cxb5 12.Bxb5 Bd7 13.Be2 b5 14.Nbd2, and while the position is objectively even, White’s position seems easier to play.
    11. Nc3 Nxc3 12.Qxc3+

12...f6 13.h4
    13. Be2!? Be6 14.0-0 Nd7 15.Rac1 Rfc8 16.d3 Nb6 17.Nd2 when White should be an inkling better, but it clearly is not by much.
13...h5
Thus far, we have been following Konstantinov-Feletar, ICCF email 2018, which was more or less even, but I like White’s position after
    14. Bd3 Bg4 15.Be4 Ra7 16.d3 Nd7 17.Nd2 and White’s pieces leave a better impression.
