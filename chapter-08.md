# Chapter 8: Other Set-ups with 1...Nf6 & 2...e6

This chapter will cover the lines that are not discussed in the previous couple of chapters. Generally speaking, Black can often either equalize or get very close to it.

1.b4 Nf6 2.Bb2 e6 3.b5 c6
The ...c7–c6 move looks a little odd but has been played several times, also by quite strong players. However, there are a couple of interesting alternatives:
    a) 3...b6 4.e3 Bb7 5.Nf3 Be7 6.Be2 (we are now in the Queen’s Indian territory) 6...d6 7.0-0 0-0 8.c4 c5 (8...Nbd7 is covered in our Queen’s Indian chapter) 9.d3 Nbd7 10.a4 Qc7 (or 10...a5 11.bxa6 Rxa6 12.Nc3 Ne8 13.d4 cxd4 14.exd4 Ra8 15.Nd2 Ndf6 was played in Remling-Lputian, Biel 1997, and now 16.d5 (16.Ba3!? is also interesting) 16...exd5 17.Bf3 Nc7 18.cxd5 Nfxd5 19.Nc4 Nxc3 20.Bxc3 Bxf3 21.Qxf3 Ne6 22.Rfb1 and White has some pressure) 11.Qc2 d5 12.Nbd2 e5?!


(this is a relatively common mistake, it looks reasonable to grab space but it weakens the light squares) 13.cxd5 Nxd5 14.Nc4 (another option is 14.Qb3, for instance, 14...Bf6 15.g3 a5 16.Nc4 Nb4 17.e4 and White has a clear advantage) 14...Bf6 15.Rfc1 Rfe8 16.Qb1 e4 17.dxe4 Bxb2 18.Qxb2 Rxe4 19.a5 Nb4? (19...Rd8 was better although 20.Rd1 Ree8 21.axb6 axb6 (or 21...N7xb6 22.Na5) 22.Ra7 leaves White with a large advantage) 20.Ncd2 Ree8 21.Qxb4 and Black resigned, 1– 0, Maeurer-Handke, Cappelle la Grande 2002.
    b) 3...c5 4.c4, and now:

b1) 4...a6 5.a4 axb5 6.axb5 Rxa1 7.Bxa1 b6 (or 7...d5 8.e3 Bd6 9.Nf3 Nbd7 10.d3 0-0 11.Nbd2 with a main line type of position where the a-pawns and rooks have been exchanged; the chances are close to even but right down our alley) 8.Bxf6!? (a somewhat surprising decision to gain some time to penetrate on the queenside; another try is 8.Nf3 d5 9.cxd5 exd5 10.g3 Be7 11.Bg2 Nbd7 12.d4 0-0 13.0-0 when I prefer White’s position but Black is not much worse) 8...Qxf6 9.Nc3 d6 10.Qa4 Qd8 (or 10...Nd7 11.Qa8 Qd8 12.g3 Ne5 13.d3 g5 14.Bg2 Bg7 15.Na4, White has some pressure, but Black is solid and has the bishop pair, 15...0-0 16.Nf3 Nxf3+ 17.Bxf3 Qc7 18.0-0 Bd7 19.Qb7 Qxb7 20.Bxb7 Rb8 21.Bg2 with about equal chances) 11.Nf3 Nd7 12.g3 g6 13.Qa8 Bg7 14.Bg2 0-0 15.0-0 and White has a positional advantage and nice control over the queenside.
b2) 4...b6 5.e3 Bb7 6.Nf3 Be7 (with ...d7–d5 we have transpositions available to lines in other chapters, but ...d7–d6 is independent 6...d6 7.Be2 a6 8.a4 (8.Nc3 axb5 9.Nxb5 Be7 10.0-0 0-0 11.Qc2 h6 12.a3 Nc6 is also about equal but gives us a very different type of position) 8...axb5 9.axb5 Rxa1 10.Bxa1 Be7 11.d3 Nbd7 12.0-0 Qc7 13.Nbd2 and we have typical position with chances to both sides but where White has more space on the queenside, which makes me happy but objectively the chances are more or less even) 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 d6 (8...d5 transposes to the Queen’s Indian chapter) 9.d3 and we transpose to Remling-Lputian above.
4.a4
One of the online Orangutan Kings, Timmermans, has used a different approach to net a nice scalp: 4.c4 a6 5.a4 axb5 6.axb5 Rxa1 7.Bxa1 cxb5 8.cxb5, and now:
    a) 8...Qa5?! (this «time-gaining» move is frequently seen in positions like this, but the queen is usually poorly placed on a5, and there are no other real benefits from playing it) 9.Nc3 b6 10.e3 Bb7 11.Nf3 Be7 12.Be2 0-0 13.0-0 d5 14.Qb1 Nbd7 15.Rc1 Rc8 16.h3 Bd6 was played in Timmermans- Sarana, Chess.com INT 2020, and now 17.Rc2 would give White a small advantage as his pieces are better placed than their black counterparts.
    b) I think Black would do better to play something normal like 8...d5 9.e3 Nbd7 10.Nf3 Bd6 We have reached a position that was played in a couple of classic games by Sokolsky himself:


b1) 11.d4 Ne4 (or 11...Bb4+ 12.Bc3 Bxc3+ 13.Nxc3 Qa5 14.Qd2 Qa1+ 15.Nd1 Ne4 16.Qb4 Nxf2
17.Kxf2 Qxd1 18.b6 and White has good compensation for the sacrificed pawn) 12.Bd3 Qa5+ 13.Nbd2 Bb4 14.Ke2! (the king scoots out of the pin and perfectly safe on e2) 14...Ndf6 15.Qc2 Bd7 16.Nb3 Qb6 17.Ne5 Nd6? (17...0-0 was better and would have kept the chances about balanced) 18.Nc5 Ke7 19.Rb1 Ra8 20.g4! (in his notes to the game, Sokolsky claims that 20.Rxb4 leads to a win for White, but that is debatable; the text move is the text book way to exploit such a positional advantage as demonstrated by Sokolsky in the game) 20...h6 21.h4 Be8 22.g5 hxg5 23.hxg5 Nfe4 24.Bxe4 dxe4 25.Rxb4 Bxb5+ 26.Kd2 Rxa1 27.Nb3 Rf1 28.Qc5 Rxf2+ 29.Kc3 Qa6 30.Rxb5 Qxb5 31.Qc7+ Ke8 32.Qxd6 f6 33.Qxe6+ Kd8 34.Nf7+ Kc7 35.Qd6+ and Black resigned before he would get mated, 1–0, Sokolsky-Weinblatt Odessa 1949.
b2) 11.Nc3 0-0 12.Be2 Nb6 13.Na4 Bd7 14.Nxb6 Qxb6 15.Bxf6 gxf6 16.Qa4 Rc8 17.0-0 e5 18.Qh4
(the chances are objectively close to even, but with the weakened black kingside structure, White has decent chances of making trouble for Black) 18...Qd8? (18...Bf8! was more solid and would keep the king safer) 19.Qh5 Be6 20.Nh4 e4 21.Bg4 Qd7 22.Bf5 Bxf5 23.Nxf5 (Now White is already winning) 23...Bf8 24.f3 Rc2 25.fxe4 dxe4 26.Qg4+ Kh8 27.Qh4 Qd8 28.Qxe4 Qxd2 29.Qxb7 (There is still some work left but White is winning with his extra pawn, strong knight on f5 and Black’s unsafe king) 29...Rc1 30.Qf3 Rxf1+ 31.Qxf1 Bc5 32.Kh1 Kg8 33.h4 Bd6 34.g3 Qd5+ 35.Kh2 Bf8 36.Nd4 Kg7 37.Qg2 Qe5 38.Qf3 Bc5 39.Nf5+ Kg8 40.Kh3 Qe6 41.h5 h6 42.g4 Bf8
43.Qc6 Qe5 44.b6 Qa1 45.Ng3 Qe5 46.Qc8 Kg7 47.Nf5+ Kh7 48.Qc7 Qd5 49.e4 Qb3+ 50.Ng3
and Black resigned, 1–0, Sokolsky-Maseev, Soviet Union 1965. Please forgive me for quoting these games at length; it is always worthwhile playing through the games of maestro himself.
4...a6 5.e3 axb5 6.axb5 Rxa1 7.Bxa1

7...cxb5
Black has some alternatives at this point:
    a) 7...Be7 8.Nf3 0-0 9.c4 d5 transposes to chapter 7.
    b) 7...Bb4 (preventing White from playing d2–d4) 8.Nf3 d5 9.Be2 Qa5 10.Be5 (10.Bxf6 gxf6 11.bxc6 Nxc6 12.c3 Bd6 13.Qb3 Ke7 14.d4 Bd7 15.0-0 with another interesting position where the chances are about even; Black’s king is quite safe on e7) 10...Nbd7 11.Bb2 Nb6 12.bxc6 bxc6 13.0-0 Bd7 and Black should have equalized.
8.Bxb5 Qa5 9.Nc3 Bb4 10.Qb1
White places the queen on the semi-open b-file and protects the bishop on b5.
10...0-0
10...b6 11.Nf3 Nc6 12.0-0 0-0 transposes to our main line
11.Nf3 Nc6 12.0-0 b6 13.Qb3

13...Ba6
Black rids himself of his undeveloped and somewhat bad bishop and kills White’s strong light- squared bishop.
14.Bxa6 Qxa6 15.Rb1 with an exciting position where White is looking at Black’s structurally weak pawn on b6, Black should be close to okay after 15...Ra8
