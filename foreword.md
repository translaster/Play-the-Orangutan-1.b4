# Foreword by IM Michael Basman
When Carsten Hansen declared that he was writing a book on the Sokolsky in homage to his father, I
was delighted. I will be even more delighted when he sends me a paper version of the book, instead
of the wretched computer edition, which is on no use to man or beast.
I began playing 1 b4 (it has many names) as an adjunct to my St George experiments. I didn’t do very
well with it, because the St George is a black opening, and you have to have the mindset of a
counterpuncher; but with the Sokolsky you make the first move!
But, psychology aside, I am now playing 1 b4 slightly better, and would recommend it to all modern
players (if you want a properly difficult game, try its mirror image 1 g4).
Computers have virtually put chess players out of business and too many people see themselves as
mere appendages to their oracular masters.
So let me put a suggestion to our eager readers: why not write your own book based on your own
games with 1 b4. Please don’t use computers; use your own brain; it may be weak and feeble but it’s
the only one you’ve got and that is where you must be making improvements. Send your little books
up to Carsten Hansen, and maybe he will produce a compilation - «The People play 1b4», which will
be truly instructional, as it will be based on your own games and your own thinking.
Good hunting! Or, as Big Chief Eye Spy used to say, «Odhu Nntigo».
