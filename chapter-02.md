# Chapter 2: 1...e5 2.Bb2 f6

In this variation, Black attempts to put a cork in the long a1–h8 diagonal, stumping White’s b2– bishop. It does weaken the Black king position a bit, as well as the light squares overall. The evaluation of the line depends on whether White can open the position sufficiently to make this weakness relevant and, frankly speaking, is far from clear.

**1.b4 e5 2.Bb2 f6!?**

**3.b5**

I think this is White’s best choice. Protecting the pawn with 3.a3 gives Black a comfortable game, for instance, 3...d5 4.d4 (or 4.e3 c6) 4...e4 5.c4 (or 5.e3 Be6 6.c4 c6 7.Nc3, both leading to, more or less, the same position where Black is okay) 5...c6 6.e3; The Gambit continuation 3.e4 Bxb4 4.Bc4 is fun but is not adequate for White. Therefore, I will not cover it as part of our repertoire.

**3...d5**

The central pawn advance makes more sense than the alternatives, which we will nevertheless take a brief look at:

a) 3...a6 4.a4 (4.e4 takes the game into a bizarre-looking 1.e4 e5 opening; I’m not sure how to accurately evaluate the positions that arise, and the computer calls them about even. What it ultimately boils down to is whether you like to play such positions or not. Play could develop as follows: 4...Nh6 (or 4...axb5 5.Bxb5 c6 6.Bc4 d5 7.exd5 cxd5 8.Bb3 Nc6 and Black should not have any problems) 5.a4 axb5 6.axb5 Rxa1 7.Bxa1 d5 8.exd5 Qxd5 9.Nc3 Qf7 10.Nf3 Be7 11.d4 exd4 12.Qxd4 and here I like White’s position, but objectively speaking, both sides have their share of the charges, Balakrishnan-Jakubowski, Chess.com INT 2021) 4...c6 (4...axb5 5.axb5 Rxa1 6.Bxa1 d5 7.e3 c5 8.c4 (this is probably wrong and it would have been better to capture on c6, for instance, 8.bxc6 Nxc6 9.Nf3 Qa5 with chances to both sides) 8...d4 9.Bd3?! f5 10.exd4 exd4 11.Qf3 Nh6 12.Ne2 g6 and Black had a comfortable game, G.Gomez-De Lorenzo, ICCF email 2003) 5.e3 d5 6.d4 axb5 7.axb5 Rxa1 8.Bxa1 e4 9.Bb2 Be6 10.Ne2 f5 11.Nf4 Bf7 12.Be2 Nf6 13.0-0 Bd6 14.bxc6 bxc6 15.Ba3 Bxa3 16.Nxa3 Qa5 and the chances are close to even; White wants to attack Black’s center with c2–c4 while Black wants to launch an attack on the kingside.

b) 3...Bc5 4.e3, preparing d2–d4 and White is already better, for instance, 4...d5 5.d4 exd4 6.exd4 Bd6 7.c4 and White has the initiative.

c) 3...c6 4.a4 d5 5.e3 Be6 6.d4 resembles something that can be reached from our main line.

d) 3...b6 4.e3 (4.e4 is also fine) 4...Bb7 5.Nf3 d5 6.c4! and White is already comfortably better.

**4.e3!?**

![](pics/pic-2-2.png)

The main line. White prepares to challenge Black in the center, either with d2–d4 or c2–c4.

**4...Be6**

A logical consequence of the previous two moves, protecting the light squares. Black has tried several other moves in this position:

a) 4...c5 aims at building a broad center for Black: 5.d4 cxd4 6.exd4 e4?! (frequently played, but almost certainly not the best; Black should consider 6...Bb4+ when 7.c3 Bd6 8.c4!? with a sharp position where both players have played a bunch of pawn moves and only developed their dark- squared bishops) 7.c4 f5 8.Nc3 (or 8.c5!? Ne7 9.h4, claiming control over the dark squares and restraining Black on the kingside; I think White’s chances are preferable) 8...Nf6 9.Nh3 Be6 10.c5 and White has a comfortable advantage.

b) 4...Bd6 5.d4 (we saw 5.c4 c6 6.a4 Ne7 being played Bugaev-Steinitz, Moscow 1896, in the history section of this book or 5.Nf3 Ne7 (5...Be6 transposes to our main line) 6.c4 c6 7.d4 e4 8.Nfd2 0-0 9.Nc3 Be6 10.Qb3 f5 11.g3 Nd7 12.a4 Qe8 13.Ba3 ridding herself of the dark-squared bishop with a comfortable game for White, Osmak-Bommini, Chess.com INT 2021) 5...e4 6.c4 f5 (or 6...c6 7.Qa4 a6 8.c5 Be7 9.Nc3 f5 10.Nh3 and White has a good game) 7.Nc3 Nf6 8.Nh3 c6 9.Qb3 a6 10.c5 Be7 and now my computer really likes 11.b6, claiming an advantage for White whereas I like 11.bxc6 bxc6 12.Be2 when the weak b6–square and open b-file should favor White.

c) 4...a6 5.a4;

d) 4...c6 5.c4 (White can also play 5.a4 Bd6 6.Nf3 Ne7 7.c4 Be6 8.d4 with chances to both sides) 5...Be6 transposes to our main line.

e) 4...Bf5 5.d4 Bb4+ (if 5...exd4 then 6.Bxd4 Bb4+ 7.Bc3 Qd6 8.Nf3 looks a little odd but probably is better for White because of Black’s situation in the center) 6.c3 Ba5 7.Nf3 e4 (7...c5!? 8.dxc5 Nd7 9.Ba3 is sharp but also better for White) 8.Nfd2 c6 9.Nb3 and White has a nice advantage thanks to his possibilities of breaking on the queenside and playing on the dark squares.

f) 4...Nh6 5.d4 (in the introduction, we saw 5.c4 Be6 6.cxd5 Qxd5 as played in Englisch-Pillsbury, Vienna 1896) 5...Bb4+ (if 5...exd4 6.Qxd4 a6 7.a4 Nf5 8.Qd1 with a position where I prefer White but objectively speaking, it is very close to equal) 6.c3 Be7 7.c4 (as our main line leads to a lot of exchanges, White can also consider 7.Nf3 e4 8.Nfd2 Be6 9.c4 c6 10.Qb3 when I prefer to play White thanks to the play on the queenside and pressure against Black’s center, but Black’s position is fully playable) 7...exd4 8.Qxd4 dxc4 9.Qxc4 a6 10.a4 c6 11.Nf3 (11.Nd2!?) 11...axb5 12.axb5 Rxa1 13.Bxa1 Qa5+ 14.Bc3 Qxb5 15.Qxb5 cxb5 16.Bxb5+ Bd7 17.Bd3 has an approximately equal endgame-ish position; Black has a passed pawn and some structural weaknesses, particularly the light squares, which can be problematic.

**5.d4**

**5...e4**

Black chooses to close the center, which seems like the most sensible move, but there are several other choices available to Black:

a) 5...Nd7 6.dxe5 fxe5 7.Nf3 e4 8.Nd4 Bf7 9.Be2 (9.Nd2!? Ne5 10.Be2 is also possible but will likely just transpose to the positions after 9.Be2) 9...Qg5 (Black goes straight for the kingside to initiate the counterplay) 10.0-0 Bd6 11.c4 Ngf6 12.Nd2 Ne5 13.Qc2 0-0 14.c5 Be7 15.Qc3 with a small positional plus for White.

b) 5...exd4 6.Qxd4 Nd7 7.Nf3 Bc5 8.Qc3 (also 8.Qd1 and; 8.Qd2 can be considered) 8...Qe7 9.Nbd2 0-0-0 10.a3 Nb6 11.Qa5 (11.Nd4!?) 11...d4? (it was better to play 11...Kb8 but 12.Bd3 Bd6 13.0-0 is pleasant for White) 12.exd4 Bg4+ 13.Be2 Nd5 14.0-0 Bb6 15.Qa4 Nf4 16.Bd1 Qd7 17.c4 and White was winning in Filip-Babun, corr 1965.

c) 5...Bb4+ 6.c3! (White wants to play this move rather than Nd2 because the knight is of better use on c3 than on d2) 6...Bd6 7.dxe5 fxe5 8.c4 (8.Nf3 a6 9.a4 Nf6 10.Be2 c5 11.Nbd2) 8...dxc4 9.Qc2 a6 10.Bxc4 Qd7 11.Bxe6 Qxe6 12.Nc3 Nf6 13.Nf3 0-0 14.a4 (White should not necessarily rush to castle: 14.0-0 e4 15.Nd4!? (if 15.Nd2 then Black can force a draw with 15...Bxh2+ 16.Kxh2 Qe5+ 17.Kg1 Ng4 18.f4! exf3 19.Nxf3 Qxe3+ 20.Kh1 Qh6+ with a perpetual check) 15...Qe5 16.g3 Nbd7 with chances to both sides) 14...Nbd7 15.Nd2 and White has a marginal positional advantage.

d) 5...Bd6? 6.dxe5 fxe5 7.Bxe5 Nf6 (or 7...Bxe5 8.Qh5+ g6 9.Qxe5 and White is much better) 8.Bxd6 Qxd6 9.Nd2 and White has won a pawn with a clear advantage.

**6.c4**

![](pics/pic-2-4.png)

Challenging Black’s center right away.

An interesting alternative is 6.Nd2 c6 7.a4 Bd6 (or 7...a6 8.Ne2 Bd6 9.c4 Nd7 10.c5 Bb8 when both 11.Nb3 and 11.b6 when I prefer White; Black’s queenside will remain locked down for some time to come) 8.c4 f5 9.Nh3 Nf6

![](pics/pic-2-5.png)

10.Ba3 (I also like 10.Qb3 0-0 11.Ba3 for White even if it objectively is close to equal) 10...Bxa3 (if 10...0-0 then 11.Nf4 Bf7 12.Bxd6 Qxd6 13.c5 Qc7 14.h4 looks plenty good for White) 11.Rxa3 0-0 12.c5 a6 13.b6 Nbd7 (13...Qe7!?) 14.Nf4 Bf7 15.h4 Re8 16.Be2 Nf8 17.Nf1 (or 17.g3 Ne6 18.Nb3 Nxf4 19.gxf4 and only White can be better) 17...Ne6 18.Ng3 Nxf4 19.exf4 with better chances for White, but breaking through is another matter, Wantoch Rekowski-Mitrescu, ICCF email 2008.

**6...c6**

Black should hang on to the d5–pawn by guarding it with the c6–pawn. Of course, other moves are possible, but I think White will gain an advantage, for instance,

a) 6...dxc4 7.Qc2 (this little queen move, threatening both c4 and e4, is probably best. Another option is 7.Nd2 Bb4 8.Rc1 a6 9.Bxc4?! (9.Bc3!? Bxc3 10.Rxc3 axb5 11.Qh5+ Kf8 12.Qxb5 Rxa2 13.Bxc4 Ra1+ 14.Ke2 Bxc4+ 15.Rxc4 Qc8 16.h3 with another weird position where the computer likes White but it is really difficult to play for both sides) 9...Bxc4 10.Rxc4 Bxd2+ 11.Kxd2 axb5 (the alternatives are 11...Qd5 12.Rxc7 which wins for White or 11...Ne7 12.Nh3 0-0 13.Qb3 Rf7 where Black cannot be worse) 12.Qh5+ Kf8 13.Qxb5 Rxa2 14.Qxb7 and White is winning) 7...a6 8.Bxc4 Bb4+ 9.Kf1! (White can even consider the ridiculous looking 9.Kd1 Bxc4 10.Qxc4 Qe7 11.Ne2 with a crazy position that I’m not sure is definitely better for either side) 9...Bxc4+ 10.Qxc4 Qe7 11.a3! (or 11.Bc3 Bd6 12.Qd5 c6 13.bxc6 Nxc6 14.Nd2 with a messy position where White should be due to Black’s loose situation in the center) 11...Bd6 12.Nc3 and White is in charge.

b) 6...f5 7.Nh3!? Nf6 8.Nf4 Bf7 9.cxd5 Nxd5 10.Nxd5 Bxd5 11.Nc3 Bb4 12.Qa4!? (or 12.Be2 0-0
13.0-0 and White has a pleasant position) 12...Bxc3+ 13.Bxc3 when I prefer White, but it is very close to even.

**7.Nc3**

![](pics/pic-2-6.png)

Consistent: pressure on the black center.

Similar is 7.Qb3 f5 (or 7...Ne7 8.Nc3 Nd7 9.Nh3!? with a pleasant position for White) 8.Nc3 Nf6 9.Nh3 Bd6 10.a4 Nbd7 11.Ba3 and now the exchange of the dark-squared bishops will help White, but the chances are close to even.

An entirely different approach is 7.c5 Ne7 8.Qb3 Nd7 9.Nd2 f5 10.a4 (10.Nh3!?) 10...Nf6 11.Nh3!? (or 11.h4) 11...Ng6 12.a5 a6 13.b6 Be7 14.g3 Qd7 15.Be2 when White has more space but breaking through is going to be very difficult.

**7...Bb4 8.Qb3 Ba5 9.bxc6**

White can also play the Advance French-style 9.Nh3, not worrying about the doubled pawn because Black’s center is now less supported: 9...Bxh3 10.gxh3 Ne7 11.Be2 Nd7 12.cxd5 cxd5 13.0-0 Nb6 14.Rac1 with better chances for White.

**9...Nxc6**

Recapturing with the pawn is also better for White: 9...bxc6 10.cxd5 Bxd5 (or 10...cxd5 11.Bb5+ Kf7 12.Nge2 with a solid advantage for White) 11.Bc4 and White is clearly better.

**10.Nh3 g5**

Stopping the knight from landing on f4 and leaving it parked on h3 for a while.

**11. Be2 dxc4 12.Bxc4 Bxc4 13.Qxc4 Nge7 14.0-0** and White has the safer king, better pawn structure, and the overall position.
