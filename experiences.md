# My Own Experiences with the Orangutan

Since I decided to write this book, I also made the decision to play the opening in blitz games to get a better feel for the opening. In the beginning, I used it sparingly, but eventually, I played it almost exclusively because the results warranted it, and I was having too much fun not to continue the experiment.

When writing this chapter, I have played the opening in about 350 games against players rated 2200 and above on Chess.com and Lichess.org. I scored more than 70% (which is a better scoring percentage - by a 3%-point margin - than I had with White with my usual repertoire in my other games in the same period), and I had a 75% score against grandmasters. This happened despite the fact that in the beginning, I had not even studied the lines and not prepared anything; this caused a lot of peculiar hiccups, for instance, after 1.b4 e6 2.Bb2 Nf6, I forgot to play 3.b5 and lost the b-pawn against a 2400-rated player but won anyway.

Another silly accident was the mouse drop after 1.b4 e5, where I played 2.Ba3 and won, although it decidedly not because of the opening. However, when I mouse-slipped and played 1.b4 e5 2.Bb2 Bxb4 3.Bd4, I lost.

These accidents aside, I also played many meaningful games against strong players, including against grandmasters and international masters and high-rated anonymous players rated above 2500 (as well as some over 2600). One thing quickly became apparent, almost no one had a prepared answer to 1.b4, which meant the risk of being at the receiving end at some preparation no longer existed, and like me, they had to think for themselves. This developed into an advantage for me as my experience with the opening grew and as I started working on the theory.
That being said, I do not think White cannot reasonably expect to get a tangible advantage after 1.b4. However, there is a practical advantage for White in that playing the opening regularly, it will give a greater familiarity with the theory, ideas, themes, typical tactics, and what makes sense and what does not. In my games, I often saw Black playing ...a7-a5 when it only forced White to play what he wanted to play anyway.

**Statistics**

Let’s take a look at which lines Black chose in my games:


1.b4 e5 2.Bb2 Bxb4 60 games 60.2 % 1.b4 e5 2.Bb2 d6 22 games 77.1 % 1.b4 e5 2.Bb2 f6 16 games 68.8 %
1.b4 d5 2.Bb2 Nf6 3.e3 13 games 76.9 % 1.b4 d5 2.Bb2 e6 12 games 58.3 %
1.b4 Nf6 2.Bb2 e6 3.b5 d5 13 games 69.2 %
1.b4 Nf6 2.Bb2 g6 3.c4 Bg7 4.Nf3 18 games 64.7 % 1.b4 a5 2.b5 27 games 85.4 %
1.b4 c6 2.Bb2 14 games 71.4 %


These are the separate overall numbers in terms of lines played more than ten times and my percentage score as White. There are a few things to consider:
* Some lines morph into each other later, and I have not accounted for that in the stats.
* After 1.b4 e5 2.Bb2 Bxb4, I experimented with new ideas, some of which went horribly bad until I took some time to analyze them more carefully before they started to work.
* There are many minor options not covered in the above stats because they were played so infrequently.
* Oh yes, I love it when Black plays 1...a5.
Here is a look at some of my better efforts. I have left them unannotated as they are, after all, just blitz games. I may later produce a bonus ebook of these and other exciting games with more detailed annotations for those interested. Check at www.winningquicklyatchess.com for more details.

**So, what can you expect from this book?**

Rather than covering all lines, I have decided to present a repertoire for White, covering all the major and most of the minor options for Black. Occasionally, some alternatives for White are covered where it makes sense. In this, I have also included some coverage on what I call the Carlsen Method, named so after Carlsen’s recent game against Nakamura from the Meltwater Classic online event. I was impressed by the strategic idea that Carlsen introduced, and as seen above, I used it in some of my own games, occasionally to significant effect.

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, White cannot expect an objective, theoretical advantage from the opening when playing 1.b4. That does not mean that we will exclude ourselves from getting an advantage. Particularly, suppose Black takes steps to “punish” White for the indiscretion of playing b2-b4. In that case, it will often involve playing moves that would generally be termed as ill- considered, such as pawn hunting with the queen without having any other pieces developed, weakening the king position with an early ...f7-f6, exchanging central pawns for flank pawns, and so on. These concessions allow imbalances that can turn the game in White’s favor, to a smaller or larger extent, depending on the variation.

Finally, I have included a fair amount of original analysis, often starting early because conventional continuations have proven unsatisfactory. Also, I have tended to prefer lines that look like what an “orangutan position should look like” if several continuations were more or less equally good. But if unconventional play is required to punish Black’s play, I have not hesitated to recommend that. This approach can occasionally lead to very original and surprising positions that will require both players to think creatively and out of the box. This is part of the fun when playing the Orangutan.
