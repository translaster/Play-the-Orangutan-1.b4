# Chapter 12: Various Other 1st Moves for Black

The lines covered in this chapter are mostly oddball options, trying to provoke a reaction out of White.
After 1.b4, we will consider the following moves:

A: 1...c5
B: 1...a5
C: 1...Na6
D: 1...b5
E: 1...Nh6
F: 1...f6
G: 1...g5

A) 1...c5

This line is called the Birmingham Gambit. If White is not adequately prepared, Black can easily get a decent position. I have experimented with a couple of ideas in my own games and believe that White can get an edge, but it does require some original play.
    2. bxc5 e5 3.e3
The pawn advance is considered the main line. White has some alternatives:
    3. Bb2 is played more frequently but is, in my opinion, more or less harmless for Black, for instance, 3...Nc6 4.Nf3 Bxc5 5.e3 d6 6.d4 (6.Be2!?) 6...Qb6 7.Bc3 Bb4 and Black is very close to having equalized.
3.Ba3!? is my favorite continuation. In the two games I used it, my opponents reacted quite befuddled and soon got into trouble.


3...Qa5 (Black has to play this move at some point if the c5–pawn has to be recovered; an alternative is 3...Nc6 4.e3 Qa5 and now 5.Nf3 transposes to our main line) 4.Nf3 Nc6 5.Bb2 (or 5.c3 Bxc5 6.Bxc5 Qxc5 7.d4 Qe7 8.d5 Na5 9.d6 Qe6 10.Na3 a6 11.e4 with a fascinating position where White is marginally better whereas; 5.e3 transposes) 5...Bxc5 6.e3 d6 7.Be2 Nf6 8.0-0 0-0 9.c4 Bf5 10.Nc3 and White has the somewhat better chances.
3...Bxc5 4.Nf3
Unless developed on the third move, White should abstain from developing the bishop for now as it may not be needed on b2. A couple of alternatives are:
    a) 4.c4 Nc6 5.Nc3 Nf6 6.Nge2 0-0 7.Nd5 d6 8.Nec3 Be6 9.Be2 Bxd5 10.cxd5 was comfortable for White in Sitnikov-Aveskulov, Kharkov 2005.
    b) 4.d4 exd4 5.exd4 Be7 6.Nf3 (or 6.g3 Nf6 7.Bg2 d5 8.Ne2 Nc6 9.0-0 0-0 with about even chances, M.Bach-J.O.Fries Nielsen, Hamburg 2016) 6...Nf6 7.Bd3 0-0 8.0-0 d5 9.h3 Nc6 10.Re1 Re8 and Black had equalized in Vasiukov-Hecht, Dresden 2010.
4...Nc6
A reasonable and untried alternative is 4...d6 5.c3!? (or 5.d4 exd4 6.exd4 Bb6 7.Bb5+ Bd7 8.Bxd7+ Qxd7 9.0-0 and White has the marginally better position) 5...Nc6 6.d4 Bb6 7.Ba3 (White can improve with 7.Bb5! exd4 8.cxd4 a6 9.Bd3 when White has the better pawn structure) 7...e4 8.Nfd2 (or 8.d5 Nce7 9.Ng5 Nf6 10.Qa4+ Bd7 11.Bb5 Nexd5 12.Nxe4 Nxe4 13.Bxd7+ Qxd7 14.Qxe4+ Ne7 15.0-0 with about even chances) 8...Nf6 (8...d5 9.c4 is more or less winning for White) 9.Be2 0- 0 10.0-0 Re8 is fine for Black.
5.d4 exd4 6.exd4

6...Bb6
This is the better square. By contrast, 6...Be7 is too passive: 7.d5 Bf6 8.c3 Ne5 9.Nbd2 Nh6 10.Nxe5 Bxe5 11.Bd3 Bxc3 (or 11...d6 12.0-0 0-0 13.Rb1 Bxc3 14.Qc2 and White has a clear advantage) 12.Ba3 and White has a massive lead in development, and Black will be lucky to stay in the game.
    7. d5 Qf6!
Necessary as the alternatives, knight moves, are terrible, for instance, 7...Nce7 8.d6 Nc6 9.Bc4 and White is overwhelmingly better; or 7...Na5 8.Ba3 (8.Bd3!?) 8...d6 9.Nc3 and White has a clear advantage.
    8. c3 Ne5 9.Qe2 d6 10.Nbd2 Ne7 11.Nxe5 Qxe5 12.Qxe5 dxe5 13.c4 and White has the better chances.
B) 1...a5
Whenever Black flings this move at me, I instantly start enjoying myself because there is no good reason for Black to play this move at this point. It can, of course, transpose to lines covered elsewhere in this book.


    2. b5 Nf6

Black has tried a whole bunch of other moves:
    a) 2...c6 3.e3 transposes to 1...c6 2.e3 a5 which is covered in chapter 10.
    b) 2...d5 3.Nf3 c5 4.c4 d4 5.e3 g6 6.exd4 Bg7 7.Ba3 (or 7.d3 cxd4 8.g3 with a great position for White) 7...cxd4 8.d3 Nf6 9.g3 0-0 10.Bg2 Re8 11.0-0 e5 12.Re1 e4 13.dxe4 Nxe4 14.Bb2 and White has a clear advantage.
c) 2...e5 3.Bb2 d6 4.e3 Bf5 5.c4 (5.d4!?) 5...Nf6 6.Nf3 c6 7.a4 Be7 8.Be2 0-0 9.Nc3 Nbd7 10.0-0
and White position is preferable.
d) 2...b6 3.c4 Bb7 4.Bb2 Nf6 5.Nf3 e6 6.Nc3 Be7 7.e3 (7.g3!?) 7...c5 8.bxc6 Nxc6 9.Be2 0-0 10.0-0
d5 11.cxd5 Nxd5 12.a3 and White has a small plus.
e) 2...c5 3.c4 e6 4.Nf3 Nf6 5.g3 d5 6.Bg2 d4 (or 6...Bd6 7.0-0) 7.0-0 Bd6 8.d3 e5 9.e3 0-0 10.Nbd2
h6 11.a4 Re8 12.e4 and White has a sort of Declined Beko Gambit with the colors reversed. This position is much easier to play for White.
f) 2...a4 (I have faced this several times; usually, Black ends up losing the pawn because it is separated from the other pawns and challenging to defend) 3.c4 Nf6 4.Nf3 c6 5.Nc3 d5 6.e3 a3 7.d4 e6 8.Bd3 dxc4 9.Bxc4 Nbd7 10.0-0 and White is better.
g) 2...d6 3.c4 Nf6 4.Nc3 g6 5.Nf3 Bg7 6.Ba3!? (6.d4!?) 6...c5 7.e3 b6 8.Be2 Bb7 9.d4 0-0 10.0-0
Ne4 (or 10...Nbd7 11.d5) 11.Nxe4 Bxe4 12.Ng5 Bb7 13.Bf3 Bxf3 14.Nxf3 and White has a small advantage.
h) 2...e6 3.c4 d5 4.e3 Nf6 5.Nf3 Nbd7 6.cxd5 exd5 7.Be2 c5 8.bxc6 bxc6 9.0-0 Bd6 10.Qa4 and White is somewhat better.
i) 2...h5 (a hilarious attempt to ridicule White’s opening play) 3.Nf3 e6 4.e3 d5 5.c4 Nf6 6.Be2 c5 7.Bb2 Bd6 8.0-0 Nbd7 9.Nc3 b6 10.d4 and here Black’s early ...h7–h5 only weakens Black’s position and White is better.
    3. e3 g6

3...c6 4.Nf3 transposes to chapter 10.

4.c4 Bg7 5.Bb2 d6 6.Nf3 e5



We have now entered a position that is often reached from the English Opening.

7.Nc3 0-0 8.Be2 Re8

Or 8...Bf5 9.0-0 Re8 10.Rc1 Nbd7 11.d4 and White has an excellent King’s Indian position.

9.0-0 Nbd7 10.d4 exd4 11.Nxd4


11...Nc5 12.Bf3

Alternatively, 12.Qc2 Bg4 13.Rad1 Bxe2 14.Qxe2 Qe7 as played in Lombardy-R.Byrne, New York 1969, and now 15.Nb3 gives White a small plus.
12...Nfd7

Also 12...Bd7 13.Nb3 Nxb3 14.axb3 Qc8 15.b6 was better for White, Zhukov-Makarevich, corr 1972.

13.Nd5 Ne5 14.Be2 c6 15.Nf4 and White has a slightly easier position to play, Känel-Kveinys, Neuchatel 1995.

C) 1...Na6?!
Black answers White’s flank move with a provocation of his own. This move is, according to
Wikipedia, named Bücker Defense, I suppose after the German FIDE Master Stefan Bücker. White has no problems gaining an advantage.

2.b5!

Black’s idea is to answer 2.a3 with 2...c5 3.b5 (3.bxc5 Qa5 (or 3...Nxc5 4.d4 Ne4 5.f3 Qa5+ 6.c3 Nef6 7.e4 and White has a comfortable advantage) 4.e3 Nxc5 5.Be2 e6 6.Nf3 Be7 7.0-0 d5 8.a4 Nf6 9.d4 Nce4 10.c4 and White is better, the black queen has no business being placed on a5 and White already has an initiative) 3...Nc7, but White can improve with 2...Nc5

Or 2...Nb8 3.Bb2 and White has an advantage.

3.d4 Ne6 4.e4 c5 5.d5 Nc7 6.c4

White has gained a significant advantage in space while Black, in return, has gotten his knight to c7 where it is doing absolutely nothing.

6...d6 7.Bd3 e5

Or 7...Nf6 8.Nc3 g6 9.Nf3 Bg7 10.Bd2 with a great Benoni-like position for White.

8.dxe6 Nxe6 9.Bb2 Be7 10.Nc3 Bf6 11.Nge2 Ne7 12.0-0 and White had a clear advantage in G.West-H.Mortensen, Canberra 2001.
D) 1...b5
This symmetrical approach (or we can call it the Opposite Orangutan or even Polar Polish) is not as silly as it looks. I still think it is better for White, but it is not by much.

2.a4!



In this particular position, White needs to challenge the pawn on b5 right away rather than developing in the normal fashion with 2.Bb2 Bb7 (Black can also consider 2...a5!? himself, e.g., 3.c3 c6 with a rather bizarre-looking position where the chances are about even) 3.a4 c6 (If Black tries to keep the position symmetrical, it would be an outright mistake 3...a6? 4.axb5 axb5 5.Rxa8 Bxa8 6.Na3 c6 7.Qa1 and threatening both Bxg7 and Nxb5 (the bishop on a8 is unprotected), White is comfortably better) 4.Nc3! (4.e3 e6 is close to even) 4...a6 (or 4...Na6 5.axb5 Nxb4 6.bxc6 Bxc6 7.e3 with a better game for White) 5.Ne4!? d6 6.e3 Nd7 7.Nf3 e5 8.Ng3 with a fascinating position where I prefer White, but objectively speaking, the chances are close to even

2...bxa4 3.e3

I think the pawn push is better than the immediate recapture with the rook, although that too is fully playable, e.g., 3.Rxa4 e6 (or 3...a5 4.e3 e6 5.b5 d5 6.Bb2 Nf6 7.Nf3 with a pleasant game for White) 4.e3 Nf6 5.Nf3 d5 6.Bb2 c5 (if 6...Bd7 then 7.b5 c6 8.Nc3, clearing a path for the queen to scoot to a1) 7.bxc5 Bxc5 8.Bb5+ Bd7 9.Bxf6 Qxf6 10.c4 Bxb5 11.cxb5 0-0 12.Nc3 Bb6 13.0-0 and White has the somewhat better chances.

3...e6 4.c3 d5

Also 4...Bb7 5.Rxa4!? (or 5.Nf3 a5 6.b5 Nf6 7.Qxa4 d5 8.Ba3 Bd6 9.Be2 when I prefer White but Black should be doing fine) 5...c5 6.bxc5 Bxc5 7.d4 Be7 8.Nf3 and White has the better pawn structure.

5.Qxa4+ Bd7 6.Qc2



White’s pawn play looks somewhat ridiculous, especially with a dark-squared bishop hiding on c1, but this can be remedied with b4–b5 followed by Ba3 at some point.
6...c5 7.bxc5 Bxc5 8.d4 Bd6 9.Nf3 Nf6 10.Ba3! Qc7
If 10...Bxa3 then 11.Rxa3 0-0 12.Bd3 Qc7 13.Nbd2 Rc8 14.0-0 gives White a small but clear advantage.

11.Be2 0-0 12.0-0 Rc8 13.Nbd2! and White has a comfortable advantage.

E)

1...Nh6 2.Bb2 Rg8

This rook move, of course, looks and is ridiculous. Alternatively, 2...f6 3.a3 d5 4.d4 c6 5.Nd2 Bf5 6.e4 dxe4 7.Ne2 a5 8.Ng3 axb4 9.axb4 Rxa1 10.Qxa1 and White has a comfortable edge.
3.c4 e6 4.b5 g5 5.g3 a6 6.a4 and White is clearly better.

F) 1...f6
This move is obviously ridiculous unless followed up with ...e7–e5, which we have covered in chapter 2.

    2. Bb2 Nh6?!

2...e5 is the way to go.

    3. c4 e6 4.b5 c6 5.Nc3 d5 6.e3 Nf7 7.Nf3 and White is clearly better.

G)

1...g5 2.Bb2 Nf6 3.e3

Or 3.c4 c5 4.b5 a6 5.a4 axb5 6.axb5 Rxa1 7.Bxa1 Bg7 8.Nc3 0-0 9.e3 e6 10.Nge2 and White has a comfortable plus, Welling-Haukenfrers, Richmond 2004.

3...Bg7 4.c4 d6 5.Qc2 e5 6.Nc3 Nc6 7.a3 a5 8.b5 Ne7 9.Bd3

Also 9.h3 Bf5 10.d3 Bg6 11.Nf3 h6 12.Be2 Qd7 13.0-0 is better for White, Skerlik-Ignatov, ICCF email 2008.

9...b6 10.Nge2 Bb7 11.0-0 and White has a clear structural advantage.
